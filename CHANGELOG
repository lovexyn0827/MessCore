    Incompleted support for dedicated servers
    When running on dedicated servers, there are a few (known) issues that must be addressed before the mod can be announced server-side-compatible:
             - Shape handling process runs too slow to support the serverSyncedBox
             - Styles and aligning mode of HUDs couldn't be set via commands
             - The client side player information HUD doesn't work
             - The HUD and shape data sender couldn't be configured for a specified player
             - Connections sometimes gets timeout or lost
    Actually, there is still a kind of unsupported environment, that is, the guest client of a LAN game.
    As the running environment of this mod is mainly the single player game, most of the problems above will be solved after the 1.0 version is released.
